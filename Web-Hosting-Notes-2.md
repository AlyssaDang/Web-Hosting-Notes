## Web Server

**Definition:** 

A web server stores and delivers content for a website.

A web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve files that form web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients.

Browsers are Web Clients (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.). They retrieve the files on the web server. Web Servers are basically simple computer programs that dispense the web page when they are requested using the web client.

**Additional Information:**

The content of most webpages is encoded in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).

The content can be static (example: text and images) or dynamic (example: computed price or list of items a customer has marked for purchase). To deliver dynamic content, most web servers support server-side scripting languages. Commonly supported languages include Active Server Pages (ASP), JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby.

A web server might also cache content to speed delivery of commonly requested content. This process is also known as web acceleration.

A web server can host a single website or multiple websites using the same software and hardware resources, which is known as virtual hosting. Web servers can also limit the speed of response to different clients so as to prevent a single client from dominating resources that are better used to satisfy requests from a large number of clients.

While web servers typically host websites that are accessible on the Internet, they can also be used to communicate between web clients and servers in local area networks such as a companyâ€™s intranet. A web server can even be embedded in a device such a digital camera so that the users can communicate with the device via any commonly available Web browser.
