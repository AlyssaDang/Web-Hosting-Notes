## Server and Client

**What is a server? - A computer that can process requests and deliver data to another computer in its network.**
The computer on which the server software is running is known as **the Server**.
The other computer which gets service from the server computer is known as **the Client**. 
Usually, the Server is on another system, which the Client can access through a **Network**.
A computer Network is the interconnection of multiple devices (physically or wirelessly).
A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** extends a private network across a public network, enabling users to send and receive 
data as if their computers were directly connected to the private network.

The purpose of the Server is to store, retrieve, and send computer files and data to other computers (the Clients). 
The hardware requirements for the Server vary according to the server applications and the number of Clients. 
Servers generally have to work for long periods of time without interruption so the reliability and power of the hardware are essential. Because servers require stable power supply, good internet (network) access, and increased security, they are usually stored in a dedicated server room or center.

Some Types Of Servers:

    Web Server: A web server shows pages and runs apps, which are accessed over 
    the internet though a Client like a web browser. The web browser is a Client 
    connected to a web server which delivers data like web pages and the 
    information on them. In the case of a web server, the Client is most likely 
    a browser like Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Safari. 
    
    Email Server: An email server facilitates the sending and receiving of email 
    messages. 
    
    File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Server: FTP servers support the moving of files 
    through File Transfer Protocol tools. FTP server are accessible remotely via 
    FTP client programs, which connect directly to the file share on the server. 
    
    Identity Server: Identity servers support logins and security roles for 
    authorized users. 

Virtual Private Server (VPS): A virtual machine provided by a web hosting company that provides admin rights and root access 
to the Client so that you can install any required software. It caters to the individual needs of the user just as a separate computer that is dedicated to a particular user. The VPS provides the same functionality and privacy as that of a normal physical computer. Multiple VPS's can be installed on a single physical server, which each one running its own OS.
A VPS can consist of Web server software, a mail server program, a FTP program, and more such as different types of application software for blogging and e-commerce.
