#### Server and Client

        **What is a server? - A computer program that provides services to other computer programs (and users).** 
        The computer on which the server software is running is also known as the **Server**.
        The other computer which gets service from the server program computer is also known as the **Client**. 
        Usually, the Client is on another system or computer, which can be accessed through a **Network**.
        A computer network is the interconnection of multiple devices (physically or wirelessly).

        The purpose of a computer server program is to store, retrieve, and send computer files and data to other 
        computers (the Clients). The hardware requirements for the Server vary according to the server 
        applications and the number of Clients. Servers generally have to work for long periods of time without 
        interruption so the reliability and power of the hardware are essential. Because servers require stable 
        power supply, good internet (network) access, and increased security, they are usually stored in a dedicated 
        server room or center.
