## All About Web Hosting

**How a website works:** 

Your computer's browser sends a request to the website's server for something - (a page, a document, a file for running an application, etc.). The URL or address you put into the bar at the top of the browser window is the main portion of that request.

The webserver receives the request and pulls together whatever it needs to deliver back to you what you requested. The web server responds to the request with some kind of content.

Your browser shows that content to you.

**Running a website:**

In order to run a website, you need a computer connected to the internet that is capable of receiving requests, taking appropriate action, and responding. When people talk about servers for their website, this is all they are talking about: computers that store the files needed to run a website, along with the software to deliver those files to anyone who asks for them.

You could, in theory, run a website from your home desktop computer, but that would be a terrible idea.
There are many reasons for this: 
You’d have to know how to set it up properly to run a website (which is not a trivial matter).
You’d have to leave it on and connected to the internet all the time.
Your computer at home is only designed to deal with one user at a time.
If a lot of people started trying to look at your website, your computer and your internet connection would both reach their limits and your website would stop working.
Better than running a website on a personal desktop computer, you could buy a server.
This is just a bigger, faster, better computer.
Assuming you could afford it (they’re expensive) and assuming you could set it all up properly (it’s not easy) and assuming you could get a fast enough internet connection with a lot of bandwidth (expensive and not always available), you could then run your website from that server.
Obviously, this is a terrible idea. Too expensive, too complicated, too difficult.

**Web Hosting Companies**

Web hosting companies have solved this problem for you. They have bought the big expensive computers, they have set them up to work for running a website, they have made sure they have a fast connection to the internet. They’ve done all the work. When you get a web hosting plan, you are borrowing a bit of one of their computers (or a whole one, sometimes). This lets you put the files and software needed to run your website somewhere that it can easily be accessed by anyone who wants to view it. To make this easier for you, they also provide tools for managing your piece of the computer and for building and running your website. When you use a web hosting company for your website, your website isn’t in a cloud somewhere or floating in an alternate dimension. It is a collection of real, actual computer files sitting on a real actual computer somewhere, in a real building. Where that building is, and what that computer looks like will depend on which hosting company you use. And you may never see the computer or even know where in the world it is. But it’s not magic, and it’s not that much different than the computer you are using right now. Summary A website is a collection of files that sit on a computer. For a website to work well, a regular desktop computer isn’t a good choice. Web hosting companies provide fast, powerful computers so that anyone can run a website without having any special knowledge or buying any special equipment.
